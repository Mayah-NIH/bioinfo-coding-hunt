# bioinfo-coding-hunt

Welcome to **Bioinfo Coding Hunt** — a hands-on central-dogma exercise (DNA → RNA → Protein) that blends command-line practice with small Python tasks.

## Learning goals
- Practice command-line navigation (`cd`, `ls`, `cat`, `mv`)
- Read and reproduce usage instructions inside Python scripts
- Perform transcription (DNA → RNA) and translation (RNA → protein)
- Move files into a validation folder and run the final checker

## Story
You recovered a DNA sequence from a mysterious specimen. The lab’s tools are scattered, mislabeled, and a few are decoys. Your job:
1. Find the right scripts,
2. Transcribe the DNA to RNA,
3. Translate the RNA to a protein,
4. Move your protein file into `validation/`,
5. Run the final comparison to reveal the magic phrase if the protein is correct.
